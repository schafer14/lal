Obviously we are very unhappy with the way the first project turned out. Built in a mere fraction of the time that the other site was built we believe that this site is the perfect response to the questions posed by the project we did with Amaud. We split the design up into three bits. Worked separately on our individual projects and used github conflict manager to finish up our project. The three of us learned lessons about teamwork and how vital it is to have a team with reasonable members.
