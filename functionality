This project was a rush job and therefor does not have the functionality that would be expected for a project with a little more time. We have fully functionality login page with a public home page and private pages for users. We also have an RSS feature so users who have enabled RSS on their browsers will get an RSS button in their URL bar. In my opinion the coolest function is the no swearing function. To avoid vulgar language in our code the swearing function only responds to the words "banner", "schafer", "swordfish", and "noodle". If the user tries to enter these words in the content of their blog they get an error.
